# Pilights
A repository for some electronics programming on the raspberry pi for a museum exhibit

# Running

The code is to be run on a raspberry pi - the current functionality is limited to detecting an event from an
IR Break Beam Sensor. Some means of representing the appropriate circuit will hopefully be added soon.

Checkout the repository, cd into the directory and, with an appropriate circuit connected via the GPIO, run:

```bash
sudo python3 detector.py
```
